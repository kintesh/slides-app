slides app using NW.js



# Using slides-app
Use the top menu to create, open, save, preview or export slides. When editing, live preview will be updated to visualize the content.

### Preview
Use this feature to preview your slides as final product without having to export so often.

### Export
The current document must be saved in order to export. There are two options for export, Online and Offline.

* Online - exports the slides as single html file, but requires internet connection when presenting.
* Offline - exports the slides as single html file + creates slides_assets folder to keep required assets.
